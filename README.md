The documents present concern the project of my degree thesis together with my colleague Andrea Re and my supervisor Lucio Davide Spano.

# Abstract
Our thesis will focus in particular on the creation of the Debug section of the PAC-PAC Web Application, or how the user interface and persistence of the data has been implemented with regard to saving the game state.
The project was designed with the aim of providing users who do not have programming knowledge with simplified tools and methods for the conception, design and production of adventure video games and interactive fiction. In this genre, called "point-and-click", the player controls a character and his actions by interacting with a pointing device, typically the mouse. Through some original modes, photos and 360-degree panoramic shots of real environments are integrated with the interactivity typical of point-and-click video games such as the resolution of small puzzles.
Specifically, we have designed a Debug interface in the editor for the creation of the point-and-click game, with the aim of showing the creator all the states of the game he is developing, in order to help him prevent and / or to remedy the game definition errors.
